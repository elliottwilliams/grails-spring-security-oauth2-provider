If you encounter a @NullPointerException@ while using the OAuth2 plugin, you might have run into [GPCACHE-25|https://jira.grails.org/browse/GPCACHE-25]. This will occur when using the OAuth2 plugin with earlier versions of the [Cache Plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/cache]. However, the latest version at the time of this writing (@1.1.6@) seems to have fixed this issue. To resolve the @NullPointerException@ issue, either upgrade the Cache plugin or uninstall it.
