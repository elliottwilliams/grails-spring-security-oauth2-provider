Spring Security Core plugin's @securityContextPersistenceFilter@ stores state in the HTTP session. Access to the token endpoint must be stateless. The default behavior of the OAuth2 plugin is to attempt to create a new filter chain based on an existing chain definition and then replace the @securityContextPersistenceFilter@ with a @statelessSecurityContextPersistenceFilter@.
