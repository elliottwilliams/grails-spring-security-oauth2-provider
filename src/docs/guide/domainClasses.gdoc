The plugin uses regular Grails domain classes backed by GORM. There are four required domain classes representing clients, access tokens, refresh tokens and authorization codes that you'll need.

The [s2-init-oauth2-provider|Scripts] script will create the domain classes for you in a specified package and update @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@ so the plugin recognizes them. You can customize the generated classes to fit your needs. If you change the default property names, you will need to update @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@ so the plugin is aware of the changes. See the section on [domain class properties|guide:domainClassProperties] for more information.

The below discussion assumes the [s2-init-oauth2-provider|Scripts] script has been run with @com.yourapp@ specified as the package and @Client@, @AccessToken@, @RefreshToken@ and @AuthorizationCode@ as the names of your domain classes.
